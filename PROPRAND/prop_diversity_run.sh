#This script takes goodfna files and randomises to 100 based on genotype
#It relies on an input file called proprand_infile.sh which is in /home2/HCV2/Uganda/Scripts
#It requires an input file called coordinates which must list the coordinates that are required- these MUST be separated by an underscore e.g. 203_255
#These coordinates MUST be in the name of the goodfna file which is generated with HCV GLUE
#Do NOT put any other junk, especially run files in the same folder
