The proprand scripts allow you to select a proportion of reads from goodfna files that are in the same folder.
You must list the coordinates you want to select in an input file called "coordinates"
You must have the goodfna files in the same folder
File naming is extremely important - i.e. you MUST have the name of the coordinates in the goodfna filename that is downloaded from GLUE.
Don't put any extra files in your folder, especially run files

To run the scripts, just type sh prop_diversity_run.sh
